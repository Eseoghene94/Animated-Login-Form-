- A container for the animated background elements.
- A login box containing the form with email and password fields, a "Forgot Password" link, a submit button, and a "Sign Up" link.

#### CSS
The CSS provides styling and animation for the elements, including:
- **General Styles**: Resetting margins, padding, and setting global font and box-sizing.
- **Body**: Centering the container both horizontally and vertically and setting the background color.
